  The terminology...
  Space capsule

  A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry 
  capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where 
  you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, 
  and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained. -->
